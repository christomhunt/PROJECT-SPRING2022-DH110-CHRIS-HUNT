# Redesigning the Musictheory.net mobile website
## Chris Hunt

### Introduction

Since COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020 temporarily closed schools in-person teaching a lot of them moved to remote or online versions of their prior only physical product. This new category has a high demand with 5.1 million users in 2020 with a project CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 17.7% and with estimated market revenue of $130.7 million dollars in 2020 there's a ton of money up for grabs. I'm taking a look at music learning/theory websites and seeing how I can improve the overall user experience in order for people to have an easier time using the products. One will help with learning music theory to be applied to a multitude of music-related things from learning to play the piano to singing. I hope to show how we can improve the user's experience on this platforms in order to offer a great experience for each and every user.

### Clear Design Statement

The purpose of this project is to redesign the mobile website musictheory.net allowing one to easily navigate the lessons, keep track of their progress, and learn in different languages. The current musictheory.net mobile website does not do any of the prior mentioned stuff and by making changes to this website I want to help people who want to learn music theory enjoy their experience more as well as share that experience with those with different first languages than English. So, my question is: How can I change the musictheory.net website to make it more accessible for those who want to learn music regardless of their background?

### Competitor Analysis: Heuristics Evaluation

I conducted a heuristics evaluation of the musictheory.net mobile website and the Fender Play desktop website, based on the heuristics created by Jakob Nielson. I evaluated these two products so that I can get a sense of some flaws the products currently have. I noticed that the musictheory.net website doesn’t have creature comforts like Fender Play tracking progress within a less, and resuming a lesson where you left off. While Fender Play could take some pointers from musictheory.net on how to make a better FAQ page even though it had some quirks.[...read more](https://github.com/masstah/ASSIGNMENT01-CHRIS-HUNT-DH110/blob/main/README.md)

### Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing

Usability Test (UT) can show how I can improve the musictheory.net mobile website in the future as well as what I can target with future iterations. By receiving feedback from users I can create a more effective and efficient website. In my pilot UT, I tested the website musictheory.net mobile website for the task that tested whether a user can go back to the previous item selected on the website, find the FAQ section, and if they could figure out what they were missing when they submitted the contact us form.[...read more](https://github.com/masstah/ASSIGNMENT02-CHRIS-HUNT-DH110/blob/main/README.md)

### User research

I used two methods for the User Research: participant interview and observation over Zoom. I interview Nikki my friend who has been working in the music industry for a long time and felt like he would be a perfect person to give feedback on something like this.
For the observation I watched him do 2 tasks the first task I had the participant do was find a music learning service in the area or online and we talked about how they felt about it. In the second task the participant looked at the website I am working with musictheory.net and we talked about how they felt about it. Two insights I found useful were having a system that uses existing accounts instead of having to sign up and create a completely new user ID, for example, logging in via Facebook, Google, or Apple ID would enable a quicker and easier process for possible customers/users. And making the learning more fun in almost a game-like way where you get gratification after completing a lesson etc.[...read more](https://github.com/masstah/ASSIGNMENT03-CHRIS-HUNT-DH110/blob/main/README.md)

### UX storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to keep your users in mind when going through the project. When you have a name and a face to look at and consider what they might use the product for you can pinpoint shortcomings you may have that they might run into. You can also find out the users value/needs that you may not have considered when doing other research.[...read more](https://github.com/masstah/ASSIGNMENT04-CHRIS-HUNT-DH110/blob/main/README.md)

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation

Interface Design allows Designers/Researchers to put up higher fidelity prototypes with the feedback they gathered from prior tests. That way you can make sure you're on the right track. Testing different Interface Design helps identify what the original website was doing well along with what the Designer/Researcher can change.[...read more](https://github.com/masstah/ASSIGNMENT06-CHRIS-HUNT-DH110/blob/main/README.md)

### Low-fidelity prototype

The purpose of low fidelity prototyping is to see if the logic makes sense as to what you’re trying to get the user to use the functions you want to implement into the website or app you are working with. It also gives another opportunity for users to suggest stuff to be added or moved around to make their experience better. It gives you a chance to make sure you’re heading down the right path with the information gathered from the research you’ve done in prior parts of your project.[...read more](https://github.com/masstah/ASSIGNMENT05-CHRIS-HUNT-DH110/blob/main/README.md)

### High-fidelity prototype

This is a high-fidelity prototype of the website musictheory.net (mobile version) created on Figma. The purpose of this is to test the features that were developed based on the personas of Dan and Emily. I also made an intercative prototype that I was able to do a cognitive walkthrough with and get feedback as to what are possible changes I can make with the next iteration.[...read more](https://github.com/masstah/ASSIGNMENT07-CHRIS-HUNT-DH110/blob/main/README.md)

### Conclusion: what did you learn throughout the process?

In the end, I think I was successful in redesigning the musictheory.net mobile website to meet the needs of potential users like the two persons I created. The different iterations I went through during this project shows my progress in becoming more familiar with the UX process as a whole. I learned how important each stage is when it comes to doing a UX project whether it's a Design or Research-based one.

I think my first target with the redesign of the musictheory.net mobile website was to completely overhaul and make something fresh. But after getting a little further along in the project I realized that will not be the case and I just need to focus on a couple of items to fix and dedicate my time to. If I was to do this again I would definitely dedicate some more time to testing so I can develop some more features because I think the features I made are very key to the success of the app in the future. I would also be able to conduct better usability tests because after each usability test I conducted for this project I felt as if there was room for improvement and I was sharpening my skills.
